    "# An Evaluation of Naive Bayesian Anti-Spam Filtering\n",
    "<b>Authors:</b> John Caingles, Kingston Koa and Jolo Simeon\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "A tutorial for the reimplementation of the paper with the same name by Ion Androutsopoulos, John Koutsias, Konstantinos  Chandrinos, George Paliouras and Constantine Spyropoulos (2000). It uses a Naive Bayesian classifier to filter spam e-mails on a corpus found in the emails folder. The effect of attribute size, lemmatization and the use of stop-lists, among other variables, on the performance of the filter is explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "## Preparing the Tests\n",
    "For each test, we perform a ten-fold cross-validation. This means that out of the 10 folders, one is selected and the nine others are used as training data. This is iterated for each of the folders and the averages of the results are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each test, we set the attirbute size(<attrib var>), threshold lambda(<lambda var>), and which data sets are to be used (<file directory var>)  depending on what is required. In this example, the blah blah is set to 0 because divsion by 0 is LIFE!!!!!!!!!!"
